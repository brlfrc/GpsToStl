# GpsToStl
GpsToStl is a Python script designed to convert GPS data files in GPX format into 3D models in STL format. This tool provides a streamlined solution for transforming GPS tracks into visually appealing 3D representations, facilitating data analysis and visualization tasks. These 3D models can be further utilized for various applications, including 3D printing.
